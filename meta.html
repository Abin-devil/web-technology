    <p>Avengers: Endgame is a 2019 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics superhero team the Avengers.
         Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the direct sequel
          to Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and the 22nd film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Directed by 
          Anthony and Joe Russo and written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, the film features an ensemble
           cast including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy
            Renner, Don Cheadle, Paul Rudd, Brie Larson, Karen Gillan, Danai Gurira, Benedict Wong, Jon Favreau,
             Bradley Cooper, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Josh Brolin. In the film, the surviving members of the Avengers
              and their allies attempt to reverse Thanos's actions in Infinity War.

        The film was announced in October 2014 as Avengers: Infinity War – Part 2,
         but Marvel later removed this title. The Russo brothers joined as directors in April 2015,
          with Markus and McFeely signing on to write the script a month later. The film serves as a 
          conclusion to the story of the MCU up to that point, ending the story arcs for several main characters.
           The plot revisits several moments from earlier films, bringing back actors and settings from 
           throughout the franchise. Filming began in August 2017 at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County,
            Georgia, shooting back-to-back with Infinity War, and ended in January 2018. Additional filming took
             place in the Metro and Downtown Atlanta areas, the state of New York, Scotland, and England.
              The official title was revealed in December 2018. With an estimated budget of $356–400 million,
               the film is one of the most expensive films ever made.</p>
