            <p>!The title was released for several platforms in February 2019 and
                received a Switch platform release in February 2021. Apex Legend 
                is one of Steam's most popular titles and accumulated 624.47 thousand
                peak concurrent players in February 2023. In 2022, Respawn Entertainment
                also released Apex Legends Mobile.Apex Legends is a free-to-play battle
                royale-hero shooter game developed by Respawn Entertainment and published
                by Electronic Arts. It was released for PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox 
                One in February 2019, for Nintendo Switch in March 2021, and for PlayStation
                5 and Xbox Series X/S in March 2022.Generally speaking, Apex Legends isn't that
                CPU-intensive to simply play at 1080p with 60 FPS; it's more important to
                have a decent GPU in your system. There's plenty of examples out there
                of folks using older-generation CPUs like the ever-faithful i7-2600K and 
                running the game at 60 FPS on low settings, for example.</p>
